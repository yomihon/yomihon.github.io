# Dictionaries

MihonOCR supports importing Yomitan dictionaries for use with its text recognition feature. This allows you to look up words directly from the reader.

## Prerequisites

You need a Yomitan-compatible dictionary file. If you don't already have one, a good place to start is by searching for `Yomitan dictionaries` or by downloading from the links below.

**Recommended Dictionaries:**
* [Jitendex \[Terms\]](https://jitendex.org/pages/downloads.html) - An improved version of JMdict with advanced formatting and polish.
* [JPDB v2.2 \[Frequency\]](https://github.com/Kuuuube/yomitan-dictionaries?tab=readme-ov-file#jpdb-v22-frequency) - Displays frequency data based on the corpus from [jpdb.io](https://jpdb.io).
* [CC100 \[Frequency\]](https://github.com/MarvNC/yomitan-dictionaries?tab=readme-ov-file#cc100) - Displays frequency data based on internet occurrences.
* [JMnedict \[Names\]](https://github.com/yomidevs/jmdict-yomitan#jmnedict-for-yomitan) - Lists readings of various proper nouns.

## Importing a Dictionary

1.  Open **MihonOCR** and go to **More**.
2.  Navigate to **Dictionaries**.
3.  Tap the **Import dictionary** button (the `+` icon).
4.  Select the dictionary ZIP file from your device storage.
5.  Wait for the import process to complete. This may take a few minutes depending on the size of the dictionary.

## Managing Dictionaries

Once imported, your dictionaries will appear in the **Dictionaries** settings screen.

*   **Enable/Disable**: Toggle the switch next to a dictionary to enable or disable it.
*   **Delete**: Use the trash icon to delete dictionaries.
*   **Priority**: Use the up and down arrows to reorder and prioritize results from specific dictionaries.
