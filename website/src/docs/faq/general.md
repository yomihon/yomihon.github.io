Frequently Asked Questions

## Why isn't Yomihon on the Google Play Store?
**Yomihon** won't be on the **Google Play Store**.

APK-based extensions conflict with [Google Play's content policy](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/).
**Google** might take down the app due to certain content, which the developers wishes to avoid.

## Is Yomihon available for iOS/iPadOS?
There is no iOS or iPadOS version and neither are there plans for one.
Porting is difficult due to the separate codebases of iOS and Android apps.

Any app proclaiming to be "**Yomihon for iOS**" is not by us and should be treated as a scam.

## What is Yomihon Beta?
**Yomihon Beta** is the latest preview version of the app.
It showcases potential upcoming features, but it's more prone to bugs and crashes.

While it's ideal for users seeking the latest **Yomihon** experience, it's essential to keep [auto-backup](/docs/guides/backups#enabling-automatic-backups) enabled to prevent library loss due to issues.
